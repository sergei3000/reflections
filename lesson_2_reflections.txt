1. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

    A repository is created. I need it to commit there.

2. How is the staging area different from the working directory and
the repository? What value do you think it offers?

    Staging area is the part of the working directory that is included
    into the repository. It lets us tell Git which files it should manage.
