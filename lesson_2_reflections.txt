1. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

    A repository is created. I need it to commit there.

2. How is the staging area different from the working directory and
the repository? What value do you think it offers?

    Staging area is the part of the working directory that is included
    into the repository. It lets us tell Git which files it should manage.

3. How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit
per logical change?

    I can add logical changes to staging area one by one.
    I can see changes in working directory with 'git diff'
    I can check what is in the staging area with 'git diff --staged'

4. What are some situations when branches would be helpful
in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

    Branches would help in exploring possible big changes while
    still developing the main product.

5. How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

    They repeat the branch structure.
