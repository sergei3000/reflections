1. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

    A repository is created.
    I need it to tell Git, where the repo is.

2. How is the staging area different from the working directory and
the repository? What value do you think it offers?

    Staging area is a place where I put files from working
    directory that I want to commit.
    It lets me only commit changes that I want to commit.

3. How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit
per logical change?

    I can add logical changes to staging area one by one.
    I can see changes in working directory with 'git diff'.
    I can check what is in the staging area with 'git diff --staged'.

4. What are some situations when branches would be helpful
in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

    Branches would help in exploring possible big changes while
    still developing the main product.

5. How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

    They repeat the branch structure.

6. What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we
represent it in the diagram the way we do?

    The result is one merged branch.
    We do so to visualize things. They appear to be like this.

7. What are the pros and cons of Git's automatic merging
vs. always doing merges manually?
    
    Pros: it saves time.
    Cons: you still have to deal with conflicts.
