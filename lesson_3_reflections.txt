1. When would you want to create a remote repository rather than
keeping all your work locally?

    When I need to collaborate with other people on the code I write.

2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than
having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remot repository?

    Because someone may introduce changes I wouldn't want to pull.
