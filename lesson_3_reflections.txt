1. When would you want to create a remote repository rather than
keeping all your work locally?

    When I need to collaborate with other people on the code I write.

2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than
having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remot repository?

    Because someone may introduce changes I wouldn't want to pull.

3. Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.
When would you use one instead of another?

    Fork is a copy of another repository. I would use it when I don't
    have a permission to push to that repository.
    Clone is the same repository, but kept local. I would use it when
    I have a permission to push to that repository.
    Branch is a separate part of a repository. I would use it to
    develop a new feature while collaborating with others on this code.

4. What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state
of the remote stored locally?

    One can see what was done by others. And you can see
    the changes you did locally, that no one is aware of.
